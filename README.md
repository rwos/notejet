# Canon NoteJet Stuff

Archived here in the hope that it might be useful, since there doesn't seem
anything (drivers, etc) for these machines left on the net.

### `ez-drive_9.06w` - BIOS Support for larger HDDs

The exe creates a bootable disk, and that disk has a pretty self-explaining
menu. Injects itself into the boot process and fixes BIOS limitations for
bigger (> 2GB) HDDs/CF-Cards and the like.

Can also automatically create partitions.

On my Canon BN-220, using this is necessary for bigger disks to actually work.

### `CANON`

C:/CANON from a (German) NoteJet III, Windows 95. Doesn't work on its own, I'm
still collecting the drivers and stuff (I don't have an install disk, just a
working HDD with everything installed).
